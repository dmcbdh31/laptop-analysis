What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
    The biggeset challenge was getting the data scraped. I didn't think the examples that were being used helped with the issues I was having. I was able to get the 1st page scraped, but the Unique_ID stayed at 1 and when I had the number of reviews in there, I got no information into the CSV. 

What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualtion of the laptop data?
    Since I was not able to get the reviews scraped. I looked at the price comparision with the laptop specifications. I did notice that with what did scrape, the size of the laptop did not matter with the cost. From the few laptops that did scrape, the most expensive laptop was a 12 inch and not a 15 inch.
